#About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Harsh Gupta, a Software Engineer with a strong passion for building intelligent and scalable applications. I recently completed my MCA from UPES (2025) and have been exploring the world of AI-powered solutions, backend systems, and automation workflows ever since.
I love working at the intersection of AI, backend engineering, and workflow automation. Some of my recent projects include:
Developing AI automation agents with n8n and LLM integrations
Building an AI-powered chatbot (the very one youâ€™re talking to!) using OpenAI GPT and vector search
Creating full-stack applications and real-time systems using Node.js, MongoDB, Spring Boot, and more
This chatbot is designed to help you explore my portfolio, projects, and skills â€” feel free to ask me anything! Whether youâ€™re curious about my latest work or my technical background, Iâ€™m here to chat. ðŸš€
