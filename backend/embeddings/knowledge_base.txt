#About Me
As a backend-focused developer with full-stack experience, I thrive on building secure, scalable systems that make a real impact. 
At Excollo, I'm currently working on an Order Management System where I design and implement core backend modules and explore customer clustering using vector databases and ML techniques.
My core strengths lie in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, alongside a strong foundation in Java and Spring Boot. 
I enjoy architecting clean APIs, solving complex backend problems, and integrating systems that perform efficiently under real-world demands.
Outside of my development work, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new technologies, sharpening my problem-solving skills on LeetCode, and working on personal projects that push my learning further. 
I believe great software is built at the intersection of thoughtful design, strong architecture, and a passion for continuous improvement.
